GWZ manages a local workspace made from multiple git repositories.

A workspace records its member repositories and exact revisions under the
tracked `gwz.conf/` directory. Commands operate on the workspace as a whole,
so a single request can initialize, inspect, snapshot, materialize, pull, or
push a coordinated set of repositories.";

const CLI_AFTER: &str = "\
Examples:
  gwz init git@github.com:org/app.git git@github.com:org/lib.git
  gwz status
  gwz snapshot before-refactor
  gwz pull --head";

const INIT_LONG: &str = "\
Create a workspace or initialize one from source URLs.

A GWZ workspace is a local directory that owns a tracked `gwz.conf/` metadata
directory. `gwz.conf/gwz.yml` describes the workspace and its repository
members. `gwz.conf/gwz.lock.yml` records the exact revisions that make the
workspace reproducible.

Running `gwz init` with no URLs creates an empty workspace at `--root` or the
current directory. Passing one or more URLs creates the workspace and adds those
repositories as initial members, materialized from their heads.";

const INIT_AFTER: &str = "\
Examples:
  gwz init
  gwz --root /work/demo init
  gwz init --path repos git@github.com:org/app.git
  gwz init git@github.com:org/app.git git@github.com:org/lib.git";

const CLONE_LONG: &str = "\
Clone a GWZ workspace from its root repository URL.

`gwz clone` is the one-shot form of `git clone <url>` followed by
`gwz materialize --lock`. It clones the workspace root repository (the one that
owns the tracked `gwz.conf/` directory) into a target directory, verifies it is
a GWZ workspace, then materializes every member: missing member repositories are
cloned and checked out at the commits recorded in `gwz.conf/gwz.lock.yml`.

If the target directory is omitted, it is derived from the URL.";

const CLONE_AFTER: &str = "\
Examples:
  gwz clone git@github.com:org/workspace.git
  gwz clone git@github.com:org/workspace.git work/demo

If you already ran a plain `git clone` on a workspace root, run
`gwz materialize --lock` inside it to complete the clone instead.";

const ADD_LONG: &str = "\
Add an existing local git repository to the workspace.

Use this when a repository already exists on disk and should become a workspace
member. GWZ records the repository as a member; it does not clone a new copy.
Use `gwz repo create` instead when the member should be created from scratch.";

Examples:
  gwz add repos/app
  gwz --root /work/demo add /src/local-lib";

const REPO_LONG: &str = "\
Manage repository members inside a workspace.

Repository commands create or update the local member repositories that make up
the workspace. For v0, this group exposes member creation; use top-level
commands such as `gwz add`, `gwz status`, `gwz pull`, and `gwz push` for
workspace-wide operations.";

Examples:
  gwz repo create repos/new-service
  gwz help repo create";

const REPO_CREATE_LONG: &str = "\
Create a new local repository member and register it with the workspace.

The repository is created immediately at the requested member path and can be
pushed to a remote later. This supports the GWZ workflow where a workspace can
grow new repositories locally before deciding where they should be published.";

Examples:
  gwz repo create repos/new-service
  gwz --root /work/demo repo create packages/experiment";

const STATUS_LONG: &str = "\
Show git status across workspace members.

The default mode requests a combined workspace status: file paths are reported
relative to the workspace and prefixed by member path when file entries are
available. Use `--no-combined` for per-member summaries. Use `--porcelain` when
another tool needs stable script-oriented output.";

const STATUS_AFTER: &str = "\
Examples:

const SNAPSHOT_LONG: &str = "\
Record the current workspace selection as a named snapshot.

A snapshot captures the current member revisions so the workspace can later be
materialized back to the same coordinated state. Use snapshots before risky
multi-repository changes, before sharing a reproducible work area, or before
pulling all members forward.";

const SNAPSHOT_AFTER: &str = "\
Examples:
  gwz snapshot before-refactor
  gwz --all snapshot integration-baseline";

const TAG_LONG: &str = "\
Record a named GWZ workspace tag.

A GWZ tag is workspace metadata, not a git tag inside each member repository.
It stores the workspace-level mapping from member to revision, so the same tag
name can be meaningful inside this workspace without colliding with tags in
other workspaces or child repositories.";

Examples:
  gwz tag release-2026-06
  gwz materialize --tag release-2026-06";

const MATERIALIZE_LONG: &str = "\
Materialize workspace members to an explicit target.

Materialization makes the local repositories match a workspace target. It is not
raw `git pull`; GWZ plans the workspace operation first and applies the selected
target across members. With no target flag, `gwz materialize` uses the workspace
lock. Use `--head`, `--snapshot`, or `--tag` for a different target.";

const PULL_LONG: &str = "\
Move workspace members forward to an explicit target.

`gwz pull` is a workspace operation, not a direct wrapper around `git pull`.
The default target is `--head`, and the default sync policy is fast-forward only.
If any selected member cannot update cleanly, the operation is rejected before
partial mutation unless `--partial` or another explicit policy changes that
behavior.";

Examples:
  gwz pull --head
  gwz pull --snapshot integration-baseline
  gwz --sync fetch-only pull --head

Push workspace member refs to their configured remotes.

`gwz push` applies one push request across the selected workspace members. Use

`--member-path`, or `--all` to control which members participate.";
